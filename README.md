## Instruction to get the script running on your website


1. Go to [payviaupi.com](https://payviaupi.com)
2. Create your script with UPI details and copy it. 
3. Paste your script inside the head tag of your website.



* PLEASE DON'T ADD YOUR UPI ID WITH YOUR PHONE NUMBER. ALTHOUGH IT WOULD WORK. BUT EXPOSING YOUR PHONE NUMBER TO PUBLIC IS NOT A GOOD IDEA.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
